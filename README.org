#+TITLE: DOS/Hurd: an ocap'ish functional game engine

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
I'd just like to interject for a moment... What you're refering to as
Hurd, is in fact, DOS/Hurd, or as I've recently taken to calling it,
dos-hurd. -- not rms
#+END_QUOTE

* What is it

dos-hurd is a game engine (well, you can use it to build other things,
but it's mostly for games) built on top of Jay McCarthy's [[https://docs.racket-lang.org/dos/][DOS]] package
(which stands for "Delimited Operating-systems Simulator").
The Hurd layer of this package is an awful lot like the DOS [[https://docs.racket-lang.org/dos/win.html][Win]] layer,
except that users are not able to select arbitrary symbols as keys.
Instead, users must explicitly make capabilities as "channels" to
read/write to the environment.

* How do I install it?

TODO

* How do I use it

Um, I'll have documentation soon hopefully, but for now you can look
at [[file:./dos-hurd/examples/][the examples directory]].
